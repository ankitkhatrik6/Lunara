 * Lunara's own stream extractor — the three things the player needs from the
 * site's player script, and nothing else.
 *
 * Every step is done by code in this repository. [PlayerJsFetcher] downloads the
 * script the site is currently serving, [FunctionNameExtractor] reads the
 * signature function, the `n` function and the signature timestamp out of it,
 * and [CipherWebView] runs those functions. None of it is borrowed: reading the
 * script, following its rewrites and running it are the whole job, and they were
 * already here.
 *
 * A bundled extractor used to sit behind these as a second implementation. It is
 * gone: a second opinion that ships from somewhere else is also a second thing
 * that can be abandoned, and the project does not take on that dependency for a
 * handful of fallbacks.
